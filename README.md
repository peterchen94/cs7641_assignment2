## Foundation for code base is found at https://github.com/JonathanTay 


Step 1: Download code and output folders from from github: https://github.gatech.edu/cchen376/cchen376_assignment2

Step 1: Install latest version of Jython 2.7 http://www.jython.org/ 

Step 2: Download ABAGAIL package from: https://github.com/pushkar/ABAGAIL. 

Step 3: Update Abigail file path in python scripts. Near the top of each script in the sys.path.append() function call 

Step 4: Run scripts from the command line using <jython script.py> command. Scripts will dump output files in the output folder names  seen below: 

## Scripts
	1. NN_RHC.py, NN_Backprop.py, NN_RHC.py, NN_SA.py
	2. flipflop.py
	3. tsp.py
	4. continuouspeaks.py

## Folders 
	1.  	FLIPFLOP
	2.	NN_OUTPUT
	3.	TSP
	4.	CONTPEAKS 


## Step 5: Utilize the analysis ipython notebook files or python scripts to generate analysis plots for report. These notebooks are in each of the output folders. 
	
	Analysis Notebooks and Py files are located in the output folders.

	1. TSP/TSP analysis.ipynb
	2. NN_OUTPUT/NN analysis.ipynb
	3. FLIPFLOP/flipflop_analysis.ipynb
	4. CONTPEAKS/cont_peaks_analysis.ipynb
